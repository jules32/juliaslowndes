      <description>“I do think that just because something is mystical doesn’t mean it shouldn’t also be demystified.” – Elizabeth Gilbert
 Last week, I presented a keynote at the Cascadia 2018 R Conference called “Big Magic with R: Creative Learning Beyond Fear”. In it, I talked about learning R- whether you are a beginner and just started to learn R, or whether you are an advanced user and need to learn new things in R every day.</description>

      <description>Creative Learning Beyond Fear Last week, I presented a keynote at the Cascadia 2018 R Conference called “Big Magic with R: Creative Learning Beyond Fear”. For this talk, I was inspired by the book “Big Magic: Creative Living Beyond Fear” by Elizabeth Gilbert. In it, Elizabeth argues that there are five essential ingredients needed to live creatively, and they are: courage, enchantment, permission, persistence, and trust. I argued that these same five essential ingredients are needed to creatively learn R, and I talked about why these elements are also essential for advanced users to take their R skills to the next level.</description>

      <description>So, you are doing an R-Ladies presentation…that’s awesome! The short version I made an R-Ladies theme for xaringan slides. My original tweet about it:
if you want to use @xieyihui&amp;#39;s awesome #xaringan package for #rstats slides but want more #Rladies flavor, there is now a built-in theme for that (with code highlighting)! Thanks to the awesome @RLadiesGlobal starter kit. Update the CSS in your YAML to use 🧙🏽‍♀️🧞‍♀️ pic.twitter.com/YnlGSVAMsl
&amp;mdash; Alison Hill (@apreshill) November 29, 2017  The way to use the theme is to update the YAML like so:</description>
