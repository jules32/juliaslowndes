      <title>Read data with multiple header rows into R</title>

      <description>A problem I run up against a lot when working with other people’s data is having multiple header rows in the source data file. I like to use readr functions to read in rectangular data like .csv and .tsv files, but if you skip rows at import using the skip argument, you lose the header row as well, which usually has column names. The problem I often have is that the header row has column names that I want to keep, but I’d like to skip the second row (or more), which has some junk in it.</description>

      <description>“I do think that just because something is mystical doesn’t mean it shouldn’t also be demystified.” – Elizabeth Gilbert
 Last week, I presented a keynote at the Cascadia 2018 R Conference called “Big Magic with R: Creative Learning Beyond Fear”. In it, I talked about learning R- whether you are a beginner and just started to learn R, or whether you are an advanced user and need to learn new things in R every day.</description>

      <description>Creative Learning Beyond Fear Last week, I presented a keynote at the Cascadia 2018 R Conference called “Big Magic with R: Creative Learning Beyond Fear”. For this talk, I was inspired by the book “Big Magic: Creative Living Beyond Fear” by Elizabeth Gilbert. In it, Elizabeth argues that there are five essential ingredients needed to live creatively, and they are: courage, enchantment, permission, persistence, and trust. I argued that these same five essential ingredients are needed to creatively learn R, and I talked about why these elements are also essential for advanced users to take their R skills to the next level.</description>

      <description>So, you are doing an R-Ladies presentation…that’s awesome! The short version I made an R-Ladies theme for xaringan slides. My original tweet about it:
if you want to use @xieyihui&amp;#39;s awesome #xaringan package for #rstats slides but want more #Rladies flavor, there is now a built-in theme for that (with code highlighting)! Thanks to the awesome @RLadiesGlobal starter kit. Update the CSS in your YAML to use 🧙🏽‍♀️🧞‍♀️ pic.twitter.com/YnlGSVAMsl
&amp;mdash; Alison Hill (@apreshill) November 29, 2017  The way to use the theme is to update the YAML like so:</description>
