      <description>A problem I run up against a lot when working with other people’s data is having multiple header rows in the source data file. I like to use readr functions to read in rectangular data like .csv and .tsv files, but if you skip rows at import using the skip argument, you lose the header row as well, which usually has column names. The problem I often have is that the header row has column names that I want to keep, but I’d like to skip the second row (or more), which has some junk in it.</description>
