# About me

Hi, I'm Julia, or Julie, or Jules.

I am a Mozilla Fellow and marine data scientist at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS). As Science Program Lead for the Ocean Health Index (OHI), I work to bridge marine science, data science, open science, and management. 

I lead open data science trainings through NCEAS, Software Carpentry, RLadies, and Eco-Data-Science. I earned my PhD from Stanford University in 2012.
