summary = "The Ocean Health Index is a method to measure how healthy our oceans are, and OHI assessments can help inform policy decisions. I am Science Program Lead for the OHI program, helping interested groups conduct their own assessments using our open-source tools I helped develop. All resources are freely available at <a href="http://ohi-science.org">ohi-science.org</a>. Additionally, I have co-developed the OHI Fellows Program, training graduate students with open data science tools and our workflows so they can lead repeated OHI assessments at the global scale."
